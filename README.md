# daily_log
Just a simple daily_log cli for Linux

make sure you put it in your path if you want to call it, as well as make it executable.

You can just copy this to make it work, I think... idk
```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/daily_log\ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vitadek/daily_log/main/daily_log #downloads the file to the bin
&& chmod +x /usr/bin/daily_log\ #make the file executable
&& touch ~/.daily_log #creates your log
```
